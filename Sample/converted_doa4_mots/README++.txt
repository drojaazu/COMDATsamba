These files were converted to DOA2U's format so the engine can read them.
These are only the animations, so there will be lots of errors with the character.bin


Make sure you backup your original files before replacing the DOAO mot file.

Some of the file names might be a little confusing, so just to clarify-


FILENAME = CHARACTER:

bayman = leon

boy = eliot

gokei = christie

hika = helena

hakyo = kokoro

ninja = hayate

sambo = bayman

suiken = brad wong
